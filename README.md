Currently enrolled in a hands-on Business Intelligence boot camp with TripleTen, I am developing expertise in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving and building a portfolio that showcases my ability to turn insights into action.

ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights:

Business Intelligence Expertise: Gaining practical experience in data analytics, visualization tools, and storytelling to solve real-world business challenges and drive informed decision-making.

Strategic Leadership: Leading cross-functional teams to exceed performance metrics and enhance efficiency across industries.

Athleteâ€™s Mindset: Years of competitive sports, including baseball and basketball have shaped my discipline, adaptability, and teamwork, which I bring to the workplace.

Problem-Solving & Resilience: Just like in sports and outdoor activities like fishing and boating, I thrive on strategy, patience, and overcoming challengesâ€”critical skills in data analytics.

Customer-Centric Approach: Strong interpersonal skills developed through teamwork and leadership, fostering trust, clear communication, and customer satisfaction.

Tech & Innovation: Leveraging business tools and Generative AI to optimize workflows and deliver measurable outcomes.

Bilingual Advantage: Fluent in English and Spanish, enhancing collaboration and global communication.

I am eager to combine my love for problem-solving, strategic thinking, and collaborationâ€”whether in sports, travel, or business intelligenceâ€”to drive meaningful impact in the tech space. My unique background allows me to bridge the gap between business and data-driven decisions, making me a well-rounded candidate ready to contribute to an innovative team.

ðŸ“ˆ What I Bring: A results-driven mindset, adaptability, and the ability to translate data insights into actionable strategiesâ€”all with the same passion and drive I bring to sports, adventure, and life.
